### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer who embodies patience, charisma, and continually expands
my knowledge through hands-on experience. I have a background in the food service 
and sales industry so I love the fast pace of working on new content.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on trying out new tech stacks.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently attempting to learn angular.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything I can get my hands on.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about the Dallas Mavericks, Dallas Cowboys or Texas Rangers.
- âš¡ Fun fact: My favorite pokemon is Elekid and I firmly believe 
              Demon Slayer is the Best Anime out there.
